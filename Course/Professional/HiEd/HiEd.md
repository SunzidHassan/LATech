### Example

Dear Dr. XXX,

I’m in my final year as a Cognitive Science major at XXXX, where I have been working in the lab of Dr. XXX XXX. My research has focused on attention and working memory using psychophysical and electrophysiological methods (see attached CV). I’m planning to apply to PhD programs this Fall, and I’m very interested in the possibility of working in your lab at UC Davis. I read your recent paper on XXX, and I found your approach to be very exciting.

I was hoping you might tell me whether you are planning to take new students in your lab in Fall 2019 [or: …whether you are planning to take rotation students in your lab…]. I’d also be interested in any other information or advice you have.

[Possibly add a few more lines here about your background and interests.]
- Where you got or are getting your degree
- What kind of research experience you’ve had
- and/or what you’ve been doing since you graduated.

Sincerely,
XXX XXXX
