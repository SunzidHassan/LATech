### Template

Subject: Inquiry from potential graduate applicant.

1. Introduce yourself
2. Inquire about whey are taking students
3. Make it clear why are you interested in that particular faculty member
4. Get any advice they might offer


### Example

Dear Dr. XXX,

I’m a Computer Science MS major at Louisiana Tech University, where I have been working at the Automatic Control lab under the supervision of Dr. Lingxiao Wang. My recent research has focused on combining high-level reasoning capabilities of multimodal LLMs with low-level action learning capabilities of reinforcement learning (see my research projects nad attached CV).

I’m planning to apply to PhD programs this Fall, and I’m very interested in the possibility of working in your lab at <INSTITUTION>. I read your recent paper on <PAPER>, and I found your approach of <APPROACH> to be very exciting.

I was hoping you might tell me whether you are planning to take new students in your lab in Fall 2025. I’d also be interested in any other information or advice you have.

Recent publications:
- Integrating vision and olfaction via Multi-modal LLM for Robotic Odor Source Localization (Project Page).
- Robotic Odor Source Localization with supervisied learning algorithm (Project Page).
- Multi-modal Robotic Platform Developmetn for OSL (Project Page).

Currently, I am doing simultaneous MS in Electrical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering, and I hope to graduate Summar, 2025.

- Where you got or are getting your degree
- What kind of research experience you’ve had
- and/or what you’ve been doing since you graduated.

Sincerely,
XXX XXXX

I hope this message finds you well. I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science (CAM) at Louisiana Tech University, currently working as a research assistant in the Automatic Control Lab under Dr. Lingxiao Wang. My research focuses on applying AI to robot navigation. I previously earned my Master’s in Computer Science with a 4.0/4.0 GPA, completing interdisciplinary coursework in computer science, mathematics, neuroscience, and electrical engineering.

I am preparing to apply for PhD programs this fall, with a focus on cognitive robotics.



Details about my projects and publications are available on my website and in the attached CV.

Project of Interest: Trustworthy Interaction & Multi-UAV Systems

I have experience in customizing and developing Raspberry Pi and ROS-based mobile robots. Currently, I am building a quadcopter that integrates Raspberry Pi with a Pixhawk flight controller. Additionally, I have hands-on expertise in ROS programming and Gazebo simulations for robot navigation.

I have applied GPT APIs and Hugging Face LLMs for robot navigation and have practical experience in implementing deep supervised learning and reinforcement learning using PyTorch and TorchRL.

I am deeply interested in application of human cognitive research in human-robot interaction. To strengthen my understanding of the intersection between neuroscience and engineering, and am currently collaborating on a brain genomics project, I plan to pursue a Master's in Biomedical Engineering by Summer 2025.
Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I was hoping you might tell me whether you are planning to take new students in your lab in Fall 2025. I’d also be interested in any other information or advice you have.

Sincerely,

Sunzid Hassan

Dear Dr. XXX,

I hope this message finds you well. I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science (CAM) at Louisiana Tech University. I previously completed my Master’s in Computer Science with a 4.0/4.0 GPA, with coursework spanning computer science, mathematics, neuroscience, and electrical engineering. I am planning to apply to PhD programs this fall, focusing on cognitive robotics.

Currently, I am working as a research assistant in the Automatic Control Lab under Dr. Lingxiao Wang. My research involves applying AI to robot navigation, with recent work focusing on integrating vision and olfaction with large language models (LLMs) for navigation in both simulated and real-world environments. You can find details about my projects and publications on my website (sunzid.com) and in the attached CV.

I have reviewed your work on visual cognition and vision-based robot design, which strongly resonates with my academic and research aspirations. I was hoping you might tell me whether you are planning to take new students in your lab in Fall 2025. I’d also be interested in any other information or advice you have.

Thank you very much for your time and consideration. I look forward to hearing from you.

Sincerely,
Sunzid Hassan
