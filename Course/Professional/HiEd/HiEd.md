## Faculty Email

### Benefits
- Maybe the faculty is not hiring
- S/he can give you insight
- You'll be in his/her consciousness from then on


### Template

Subject: Inquiry from potential graduate applicant.

1. Introduce yourself
2. Inquire about whey are taking students
3. Make it clear why are you interested in that particular faculty member
4. Get any advice they might offer


### Example

Dear Dr. XXX,

I’m a Computer Science MS major at Louisiana Tech University, where I have been working at the Automatic Control lab under the supervision of Dr. Lingxiao Wang. My research has focused on combining high-level reasoning capabilities of multimodal LLMs with low-level action learning capabilities of reinforcement learning (see my research projects nad attached CV).

I’m planning to apply to PhD programs this Fall, and I’m very interested in the possibility of working in your lab at <INSTITUTION>. I read your recent paper on <PAPER>, and I found your approach of <APPROACH> to be very exciting.

I was hoping you might tell me whether you are planning to take new students in your lab in Fall 2025. I’d also be interested in any other information or advice you have.

Recent publications:
- Integrating vision and olfaction via Multi-modal LLM for Robotic Odor Source Localization (Project Page).
- Robotic Odor Source Localization with supervisied learning algorithm (Project Page).
- Multi-modal Robotic Platform Developmetn for OSL (Project Page).

Currently, I am doing simultaneous MS in Electrical Engineering and Biomedical Engineering, and I hope to graduate Summar, 2025.

- Where you got or are getting your degree
- What kind of research experience you’ve had
- and/or what you’ve been doing since you graduated.

Sincerely,
XXX XXXX

Lab: Interactive Robotics
Vision: In Interactive Robotics Group (IRG), our work converges to a single goal of harnessing the relative strengths of humans and robots to accomplish what neither can do alone.

Recent research of interest: I recenty read your paper on ALGAE, that combined language-models with inverse reinforcement learning for learning reward function from concise demonstrations
