## Lumped Circuit Abstraction:

In physics, we do Point Mass discretization to assume $F=ma$, considering the entire mass of an object is in a point. Similarly, we can consider a light bulb as a resistance, and get $I=\frac{V}{R}$ for current flow in the light. 

For the light bulb filament, considering
