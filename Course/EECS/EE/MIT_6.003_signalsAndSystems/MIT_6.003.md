## Signals and Systems
* We can represent systems as something that takes an input signal of choice and gives an output signal of choice.
* They can be easily combined.
* Signals are mathematical functions, with independent variable of time, and dependent variable (voltage, flow rate, etc.)

### Signals
* Signals from physical systems are often functions of continuous time. Signals from computation systems are often functions of discrete time.
* Continuous signal can be converted to discrete signal by sampling at intervals.
* Discrete signals can be converted to continuous signal, e.g., by zero-order hold or piecewise linear.
