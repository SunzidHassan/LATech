BIOM 510: graph rules
- get rid of box
- Black text, and possibly lines/points as well
- no reason to connect the dots, you can fit regression if needed
- theory with solid line, points for measurement
- put units at the end of axis titles (Frequency (Hz), Magnitude (dB))
- no main title
- axis tick mark
- Excel/LTspice bode plot: 3+ (preferably 20) points per octave
- data from oscilloscope: solid line
