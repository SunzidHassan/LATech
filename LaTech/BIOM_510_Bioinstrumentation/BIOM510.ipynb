    "Goals:\n",
    "1. Highlight connections between instrumentation and mechanical, electrical, and chemical engineering disciplines.\n",
    "2. Provide an understanding of the basic concepts of instrumentation that are needed to take measurements from the body, design biomedical instruments, and to model, theoretically, certain aspects of the body.\n",
    "3. Highlight aspects of electrical engineering concepts, such as positive and negative feedback, that can be used to understand and quantitatively model physiological phenomena, such as oscillatory cycles."
