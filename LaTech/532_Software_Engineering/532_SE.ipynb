    "## 01. Adding more manpower to a late software project makes it later\n",
    "Software engineers are optimists in general, and they incorrectly assume that the project will go well. In the book “The Mind of the Maker”, creativity is divided in three stages – the idea, the implementation and the interaction. Since programming medium is tractable, a programmer assumes few difficulties in implementation. But the inconsistencies of the idea become clear during implementation of a large programming project. \n",
    "The assumption that more manpower will make the project finish faster doesn’t hold for projects that require communication among the workers. In tasks that can be partitioned but require communication among subtasks, the training and intercommunication can actually lengthen the schedule.\n",
    "Software managers often don’t negotiate project delivery timeline if the project schedule overruns. Sharing productivity, bug, estimation data can help customers accept extended delivery time.\n",
    "Because of optimism, programmers often assume the number of bugs to be smaller than it usually is. A good rule of thumb is to assign one-third of the time for planning (larger than normal but still insufficient), one-sixth for coding (as it’s easy to estimate), half of the time for debugging (larger than normal but practically needed). Since debugging part comes at the end, the secondary costs of project overrun is often significant.\n",
    "In case of project overrun in the first phase, it can firstly be assumed that the underestimation only applies for the first phase, and increase manpower to cover the overrun. This in turn will add training and communication requirement that can further overrun the project. Secondly, it can be assumed that the overrun represents actual time requirement, and the total project will require longer schedule. So, enough time can be taken so that further rescheduling is unnecessary. Lastly, the project can be trimmed in a planned way to reduce time requirements.\n",

    "## 02. Scaling\n",
    "In many engineering disciplines, it is known that a small-scale experiment needs to be tested in a medium scale first before implementing it in a large-scale system. The same is applicable for programming projects as well, and software development management must plan for piloting and redeveloping.\n",
    "This is mandatory as change of user need is inevitable for software products or services. There needs to be a defined balance of the extent to which the developer needs to meet changing customer needs. The preparedness to meet this change needs to be incorporated in planning.\n",
    "Practices like modularization, subroutine, defining intermodular interfaces,  documentation, standard calling sequences and table-driven techniques, high-level language and self-documenting techniques, compile-time operations to incorporate standard declarations, quantization of change, numbering product versions with schedule and freeze date should be practiced. \n",
    "The planning process of the entire organization should facilitate change. Designers need to be responsible for the changes they make and document the design decisions. Sociological attention should be applied to make workforce interchangeable between development and management roles.\n",
    "Updating a software system often leads to new issues, which makes existing software system fragile with increasing updates. Thus, every software system must be developed from ground up after a threshold.\n",

    "## 03. Productivity increase\n",
    "All software development involves essential tasks that include transforming concept into reality and accidental tasks that include representing the concepts in programming and machine language. A number of approaches can help with essential parts – exploiting what can be bought in mass market, using rapid prototyping to fix software requirements, growing features iteratively while they are in use, developing conceptual designers of rising generation. The essential difficulties of Software engineering include complexity. Software is the most complex entity for its size with complex non-linearities. Unlike other disciplines, software development has no objective conformity. It’s subject to constant change that increases entropy. The invisibility of software also makes agreement hard. In order to make improvements, refinement and rapid prototyping, incremental development, great designers is required.\n",

    "## 04. Naming\n",
    "**Use intention-revealing names**\n",
    "Why it exists, what it does, how it's used. E.g.,\n",
    "int elapsedTimeInDays, int daysSinceCreation, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid disinformation**\n",
    "Avoiding reserved names, naming similar concepts similarly, avoiding using 'O' and 'l'.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Make meaningful distinctions**\n",
    "Avoiding noninformative number-series naming. Distinguishing name should indicate their difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use pronounceable names**\n",
    "Humans are good at pronouncing words, and variable names should be pronounceable.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Use searchable names**\n",
    "Single-letter or numeric names are harder to search and thus should not be used for naming variables with wide scope.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Avoid encodings**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hungarian notation**\n",
    "It is better to avoid type encoding since it's not mandatory with modern languages with complex options.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Member prefix**\n",
    "Names should not be too long that they need prefix."
