    "Terms to know:\n",
    "1. Oxidative reactions: electrone transfer reaction. E.g., nutrient to energy release reactions (to ATP) in mitochondria.\n",
    "2. ADP: Adenosine diphasphate.\n",
    "3. Cilia: Ciliary movement is a whiplike motion of cilia on the surfaces of cells. E.g., surfaces of respiratory airways.\n",
    "4. Deoxyribose: sugar\n",
    "5. Hydrogen bonds: weak chemical bond\n",
    "6. Genetic code: the code that controls the formation of proteins in the cell.\n",
    "7. Triplet codons: genetic code consists of successive triplets of bases - code word that results in an amino acid, sequence of which make up the final protein.\n",
    "8. Transcription: the process of transferring DNA code in nucleus to an RNA code in cytoplasm.\n",
    "9. Ribose: in RNA instead of deoxyribose in DNA.\n",
    "10. RNA polymerase: enzyme that helps formation of RNA.\n",
    "11. Promoter: DNA strand immediately ahead of the initial gene is a sequence of nucleotides called promoter. RNA polymerase has an appropriate complementary structure that recognizes this and becomes attached to it. This is the intial step of RNA formation.\n",
    "12. Covalent bond: stronger chemical bond\n",
    "13. Chain terminating sequence: method of DNA sequencing.\n",
    "14. mRNA: messenger RNA. In the ribosome, each specific tRNA recognizes a particular codon on the messenger RNA. Thus tRNA delivers appropriate amino acid to the appropriate place in the chain of the newly forming protein molecule.\n",
    "15. tRNA: transfer RNA - transfers amino acid molecules to protein molecules in ribosomes as protein is synthesized.\n",
    "16. Ribosomal RNA: about 60% of ribosome, rest is proteins - both helps protein formation. Forms and collects in nucleolus.\n",
    "17. Start signal: a codon that represents signal 'start'.\n",
    "18. Anticodon: the specific triplet code in the tRNA that allows it to recognize a specific codon is anticodon. Located in the middle of tRNA. During formation of protein molecule, anticodon bases combine loosely by hydrogen bonding with codon bases of mRNA.\n",
    "19. Translation: when mRNA travels through the ribosome, protein molecule is formed with translation.\n",
    "20. Polyribosomes: clusters of ribosome attached to single mRNA that forms protein molecules at several ribosomes at the same time.\n",
    "21. Polypeptide: protein\n",
    "22. Peptide linkage: amino acid in protein chain are linked via a peptide linkage.\n",
    "23. Operon: Synthesis of a cellular biochemical product usually requires a series of reactions, and each of these reactions is catalyzed by a special protein enzyme. Formation of all the enzymes needed for the synthesic process often is controlled by a sequence of genes located one after another on the same chromosomal DNA strand. This area of the DNA is called an operon, and the genes responsible for forming the respective enzymes are called structural genes.\n",
    "24. Repressor protein: a band of nucleotides lying in the middle of the promoter called repressor. A regulatory protein can bind here and prevent attachment of RNA polymerase to the promoter - blocking transcription of the genes of this operon.\n",
    "25. DNA polymerase: the principle enzymes for replicating DNA are DNA polymerase, comparable to RNA polymerase. It attaches to and moves along the DNA template strand while another enzyme, DNA ligase, causes bonding of successive DNA nucleotides one to another, using high energy phosphate bonds.\n",
    "26. Ligase\n",
    "27. DNA proofreading: during the hour between DNA replication and the beginning of mitosis, there is a period of active repaid and proofreading of the DNA strands. Whenever inappropriate DNA nucleotides have been matched up with the nucleotides of the original template strand, special enzymes cut out the defective areas and replace these with appropriate complementary nucleotides using same DNA polymerase and ligase used in replication.\n",
    "28. Mutation: despite proofreading, if a mistake is made, it is called mutation - leading to abnormal protein formation, abnormal cellular function, even cell death.\n",
    "29. Human genome: there are 25k+ genes in the human genome, each represented by two seperate sets of chromosomes with almost identical genes.\n",
    "30. Histones: in addition to DNA, there are large amount of protein composed of small electropositively charge histone molecules in chromosomes. Small segments of DNA are coiled sequentially with histone cores. When DNA is packaged in histones, they can't function as a template for either RNA formation or replication of new DNA.\n",
    "31. Contact inhibition: cells stop growing when they run out of space for growth.\n",
    "32. Cell differentiation: change of physical and functional properties of cells as they proliferate in the embryo for form different bodily structures and organs. Proliferation and differentiation can't happen at the same time.\n",
    "33. Apoptosis: when cells are no longer needed or become a threat to the organism, they undergo a suicidal programmed cell death or apoptosis.\n",
    "Cell necrosis: injury death of cell, causes inflammation.\n",
    "34. Caspases: apoptosis is initiated by activation of a family of proteases called caspases.\n",
    "35. Oncogenes: cancer is caused by abnormal activation of oncogenes that control cell growth and mitosis.\n",
    "36. Carcinogens: chemical substances that increases probability of cancer.\n",
    "37. Angiogenic factors: some cancers produce angiogenic factors that cause new blood vessels to grow into the cancer - thus supplying more nutrients.\n",
